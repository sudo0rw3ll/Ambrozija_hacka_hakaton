# The Great Hacka Hackathon
This repository contains source code for the backend which was part of the project
made in 24h during the hackathon.  

To learn more about the idea and challenges we've faced, please continue to read!  

# Meet the team!
I'm so gratefull for being able to have a great time and develop a great solution
with these, first of all, awesome people and friends, and second, really good engineers.

During the 24 hours, we've faced big challenges, ups and downs but the good spirit and persistance took
care of it. Most important things were good organization and planning. 

Let me introduce you to the people I've mentioned above.

Machine Learning part was done by Jefimija Najdić, Vanja Kovinić and Mihajlo Madžarević. (BIG UP FOR THIS)

Amazing frontend was developed in a matter of seconds by Luka Lazarević.

Here, I'll pin their repositories:

# The problem
Based on the data collected from different stations across the country, we had to predict the concentration
of Ambrosia pollen in the air for the next three days. The data contained information about weather conditions (wind speed, temperature, etc.),
locations, types of plants and concentration of pollen each of these produce, date when the data was collected etc.

Our team spent the most time doing the cleansing part and figuring out the relations between the data in order to remove
unescessary features. The whole soultion went through many iterations until the perfect model has been created.

For the long time, we held the first place on the leaderboard out of 15 teams in total. 

After benchmarking the model on 45% of the unknown data we ended up as the second on the leaderboard with the score of 16.489.

# The idea
When we heard about the problem we asked ourselves what are we going to do with the model once we train it?

How we can use it?

We ended up with an idea of creating an app named PollenReady which would enable users to track basic metrics about the pollen concentration
and implementing the heatmap which would enable to visualize how bad concentration of pollen is in different areas of the city
user is interacting with our app from. Also, people would be able to search for different medication and the nearest drugstores
using our app. Other part of the idea, which included the bussines strategy was not implemented during these 24h due to the
number and complexity of the features.
